##Data Modification

The data set provided as part of this project has been adapted from above mentioned source data.

The following modification have been made:

1.      Combination of 8 source files:

	*x_test.txt
        *y_test.txt
        *subject_test.txt     
        *x_train.txt
        *y_train.txt
        *subject_train.txt
       	*features.txt
        *activity_labels.txt

2.      Creation of a subset that includes only variables that are relevant for the course project:

	*Source data includes measurements for 561 variables
	*Subset includes data that is derived from 86 of these variables. Please refer to the Appendix A below for the complete list.

3.	The data will be returned by run_analysis.R as *.txt in the working directory. It is in the long form of tidy data. 


##Data Dictionary

Column 1:	subject - *integer*

	*Values 1 through 30 representing the 30 individuals that particpated in the study.


Column 2:	activity - *factor*

	*The 6 activities that were recorded:

		*WALKING
		*WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		*WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		*SITTING
		*STANDING
		*LAYING


Column 3:	measure - *factor*

	*The 86 variables that are of interest to this course project.Please refer to the Appendix A below for the complete list.


Column 4:	mean - *numeric*

	*The mean of measurements for each combination of subject-activity-measure.
